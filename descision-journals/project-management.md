## Tooling

### GitHub: Project Management and Code Management

The FYDP team has setup a private GitHub Organization managed by `git` and hosted on `https://github.com`

**Reasoning**: This was done so that all contributions, documentation and code is trackable, reviewable and discoverable. It can easily be shared with individuals who may need access, and made public or private when desirable. Using GitHub also lets us utilize GitHub Projects all within the same system. This means we can use as few tools as possible and cross-link issues and tasks as needed. Using GitHub for project management as well as code management allows us to leverage the _code review process_ to ensure high code quality when applicable as well as review documentation as required.

### Notion: Note Taking and Brainstorming

The FYDP team has setup a [Notion Page](https://www.notion.so/FYDP-559650aae94144f5827798bad7964bf2) to brainstorm, take notes and make decisions quickly. These are then reflected in GitHub in the form of formal documentation

**Reasoning**: Notion is better than GitHub for real-time collaborative document writing and embedding content, however it is not as robust or auditable as GitHub.

### Google Suite (Sheets, Docs, Slides, Meet): Document Writing, Basic Analysis, Presentations, Meetings

The FYDP team has setup a google drive where we store deliverable documentation, presentations or any other deliverable that would require collaboration and multiple authors. Consider the project description. This is best written in Google Docs as it facilitates collaboration in real time.

**Reasoning**: Google Drive ensure safety of documents as they are stored on Google's cloud. It also allows multiple project members to work on the same document at the same time. It features a much more rich text editing, and analysis toolset compared to Notion.

## Task Management

Task management is managed by GitHub issues. Tasks are actionable items that one or more team members can complete in the form of issues. When a task is created it is the responsibility of the task creator to ensure that the task aligns with the issue template and has appropriate labels associated with it
