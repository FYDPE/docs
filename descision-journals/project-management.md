# Project Management: FYDP

## Tooling

The FYDP team has setup a private GitHub Organization managed by `git` and hosted on `https://github.com`

**Reasoning**: This was done so that all contributions, documentation and code is trackable, reviewable and discoverable. It can easily be shared with individuals who may need access, and made public or private when desirable. Using GitHub also lets us utilize GitHub Projects all within the same system. This means we can use as few tools as possible and cross-link issues and tasks as needed. Using GitHub for project management as well as code management allows us to leverage the _code review process_ to ensure high code quality when applicable as well as review documentation as required.
