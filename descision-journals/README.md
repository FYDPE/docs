# Decision Journal

Decision journals are used to keep track of the various decisions that team members make at points in the design process. It is a form of accountability, but also serves as a great reference for when we want to go back and ask _why_ we made specific decisions when we did, and quickly understand the reasoning behind them. They also force us to reason-through and document all of the decisions that we make.
