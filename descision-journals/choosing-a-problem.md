# Choosing a Problem Space

## Problem of Choice (September 9 2022)

### Optimized Prescription Drug pickup at Pharmacies

May pharmacies can experience customer service backlogs that put strain on assistants and customer service relationships. Pharmacists spend large amounts of time with hundreds of patients taking the same routine medication, when their time would be better spent with patients who have more acute needs. It also degrades the customer service experience for patients who do not want to have to spent time waiting in line at the pharmacy.

We want to design a solution to allow customers to pickup their prescribed medication in a safe and optimized manner, improving customer experience for patients of all kinds and reducing the customer service workload placed on pharmacists giving them the time to provide better care for their patients who need it the most

**Reasoning** This problem was chosen because it does not appear to have an existing solution, it has multiple users which we can gain access to, and is a well documented problem space in Canada and the United States.
