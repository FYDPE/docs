## Agenda and Notes

1. Quick Review of the results from our customer (patient) surveys
2. Discuss strategies to conduct user interviews with pharmacists, pharmacy assistants and pharmacy techs.
   1. How to maximize the likelihood of success?
   2. Sending a survey has a greater chance of them filling out a survey
   3. Try sending out a survey on twitter or LinkedIn, using hashtags. Send to Dr. Faisal so that they can share it on the blog. Mention that it will take less than a minute to complete. On advice from Dr. Faisal not worth conducting in-person interviews because of high levels of workplace stress at this time. Due to Covid boosters/flu `vaxx`, etc.
   4. Send Dr. Faisal link to survey.
3. We need more pharmacists to complete our survey! (currently only two respondents)
4. Update: What our plan is â†’ We will be beginning work on a low-fidelity prototype this week and next week. 5. Go in-person to the campus pharmacy for help with the project. We would like to test the project. Dr. Faisal to reach out to network for possible additional pharmacy location where we could test the system. 6. `Fillware` and Nexus are better solutions to Kroll, Shoppers has their own system. POS is not integrated. `Rexall`, and Shoppers have an integrated system.
