# Meeting October 7th 2022

## Todo:

- Figure out way to handle/manage high volume of responses from survey respondents between first bracket
- Handle duplicates (by checking email, do we want additional checks?)
- Drafted list of patient analysis questions
- Respondents that are 65+ answering the survey are already biased to using tech, not an accurate representation of the group
- NOTE TO SAMMY: research pharmacy payments side
  - Narrow in on technology that certain pharmacies use (campus pharmacy etc)
  - API that can be integrated w many solutions could be a better/more versatile option compared to creating a solution for a specific pharmacy
  - Also could be a software-level interoperability solution (solely a notification system)

## Low Fidelity Prototype:

- REMINDER: end of next week weâ€™ll have a low fidelity prototype
- NOTE TO SAMMY: make issues on GitHub for low-fidelity prototype
- Focus on 1 pharmacy for 1st prototype:
  - Campus pharmacy

## New Focus

- Traction with pharmacist survey
- Person-on-the-street type surveys
- Research about pharmacy tech/payment system etc.
- Low-fidelity prototype
