## Notes:

- Box doesn’t always automatically open
  - The QR code scanning works, and we hear something being triggered, but the spring doesn’t make the front box door open itself
- The interface doesn't update once the box is open and closed
  - You need to refresh to get it to update
    - Patient side is good, once you close the QR code it will move straight to previous pickups.
    - However, when the prescription is created from the staff side, you must refresh the page for it to show up for patients. This is hypothetically okay since we’ll likely email them and the page will be loaded when going to the ParmaBox.
    - For staff though, the “status” of the boxes only updates upon a refresh
- User said he wanted to get confirmation that he picked it up. Once he scanned, he got no feedback on the app. This can be something like closing the QR code automatically and having a popup saying “prescription picked up”
- When Kat from SYDE was testing, she tried scanning the QR code on the actual LCD screen. She had troubles scanning it on it (obviously because it is not a scanner) and then was told to scan at the camera.
- At the camera, she put the phone against the camera, which made it hard to scan. She also had troubles with the phone where the screen would rotate
- Clayton didn’t notice when the box opened
- Clayton also had camera troubles with the QR code
- She also had trouble scanning (she didn't know where to put the QR code)
- Have a handle to open the door maybe?
- This user was quick to scan the code (had little troubles)
- The user asked where to open the box
- The box locked again by the time the user asked us how to open it
  - By this time, the code had expired (since it’s a one time code)
- No indication that the door was open
- Had to look for camera, Make it obvious with arrows
- Instructions visible on the box
- Chime when box open, more obvious indication
- Make it look better lol
- Need first instruction
- Make QR code scanning process explicit

Something I noticed:

- Will the box always be fully closed? The users have closed it but sometimes they may not.
