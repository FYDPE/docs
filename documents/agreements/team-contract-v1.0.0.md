### 4.2 Weekly Project Manager

Every week it is the role of the individual listed to create tasks that align with the weekly expectations and deliverables so that they can be tracked on GitHub. This may involve going through Learn to find things that we need to do or creating subtasks for larger tasks that are not quite flushed out. Tasks will be triaged at the beginning of each meeting, outlined in section 3.1. This individual is also responsible for ensuring that the team is meeting pace and is on track to meet specific deliverable deadlines. They are also responsible for booking meeting rooms as necessary for the week, and sending out meeting reminders. They are also responsible for mitigation strategies for the week.

### 4.3 Workload distribution

During team meetings, team members will collectively “groom” the backlog of outstanding tasks, assign estimates and labels to the tasks if none are present. Tasks will then be assigned to team members taking into consideration the size of the task, their current workload, and any external factors such as, but not limited to: elevated commitments to other courses, religious holidays, etc.

## 5 Mitigation and Policies

### 5.1 Personal Conflicts Between Individuals

Any personal conflicts between individuals should be attempted to be resolved between the members. If a resolution can’t be agreed on, the team members can escalate to the rest of the team during a team meeting. After that, if an agreement or compromise still cannot be reached, a course instructor may be contacted.

### 5.2 Project-Related Conflicts on Team Level

Project disagreements between team members are expected to be resolved with the team; using a super-majority voting system if consensus can’t be reached. All team members must be present for a vote to take place, and all team members must confirm that they have the information necessary to make an informed decision. Team members may not abstain from voting or vote via a proxy.

In the event of a conflict, team members are expected to present research findings that support their opinion and clearly and politely articulate why they feel their approach/finding/strategy is the most likely to succeed.

### 5.3 Proactive Conflict Prevention

Allocate 15 mins at the start of every Friday meeting to do team retrospectives. This time should be spent answering the following questions:

- What went well over the past week?
- What should we continue to do?
- What do we want to start doing? Action items?

### 5.4 Respect for Persons

Team members are expected to adhere to the University of Waterloo’s applicable[ policies](https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policies) and respect team members, users, stakeholders and advisors with respect. Abuse or discrimination of any kind will not be tolerated and will immediately be escalated to the Systems Design Engineering Department.

### 5.5 Territorial Acknowledgement

The Team (signatories) acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main place of work and play is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River.

Signatories commit to integrate acts of reconciliation into our work and help undo the damage systemic discrimination has done following the recommendations outlined by the [Truth and Reconciliation Commissions Final Report](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/british-columbians-our-governments/indigenous-people/aboriginal-peoples-documents/calls_to_action_english2.pdf).
