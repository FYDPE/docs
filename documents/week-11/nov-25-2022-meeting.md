# Meeting November 25th 2022

- Assigned different roles to each part of the panel exam to each team member so that everyone would have both equal speaking parts, as well as share the speaking burden
- Did a quick run-through of the presentation and found that we were way over the 10 minute time limit, so we are going to cut down what we are talking about on each slide
- Will complete the "script" by evening of November 27th so that we each time time to review it and make sure we are not repeating information.
