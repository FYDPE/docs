# Project Advisor Meeting

October 3rd 2022

## General Plan

- We are in the research phase
- Dr. Faisal → will reach out to community pharmacists to 3-4 people
- Look under the Ontario College of Pharmacists for regulations for remote pickup, otherwise, Dr. Faisal will reach out to a colleague. If we can’t find anything regulatory-wise, this signifies a gap in the regulatory space that pharmacists need to operate within See this link
- Regulations can be found on the Ontario college of pharmacists website under regulations
- Asked about the school of pharmacy contacts: she’ll reach out to pharmacists in her network, and get back to us
- Asked about regulatory space:
  - Ontario College of Pharmacists - take care of regulations (relations)
  - Previous laws about automation in pharmacies:[ https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/110058](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/110058)
  - Current regulation: [https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/160264](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/160264)
  - OCP - who can pick up prescriptions, what info do you need to show, (under the regulations tab)
