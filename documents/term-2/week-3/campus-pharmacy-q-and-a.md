<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Brief Intro</span>

**What is the problem?**

To summarize:

- Wait times for patients are long
- Something about increasing workload
- The increasing shortage of pharmacists and their increasing workload will continue to lengthen these wait times for patients
- Consequence of this, as you know, are limited accessibility of patient care, and a lack of awareness by patients of services that pharmacies actually offer
- 75% of prescriptions are repeated and in these cases customers don’t always need to be serviced

Kroll

**What is the solution?**

- For this problem we have two user groups patients and pharmacists,
- Last term we focused on patient pickup experience
  - Conducted surveys and did user testing with a prototype smart locker
  - Patients found the process convenient
  - Average pickup times of 15 seconds
- This term we want to focus on the pharmacist flow and understanding how we can design a solution around your existing workflow and process so that we can add efficiency without extra work on the pharmacy side (ask Understand Flow questions)
- (If he inquires about our proposed solution)
  - We want to implement several pickup smart lock boxes
  - If possible integrate with your pharmacy software
    - Using patient information to help populate prescription information for notifying patients
  -

Sometimes refills need to be concealed

They counsel patients because they can see if a patient comes to fill in a prescription too early and too late and can flag the issue

If they get a controlled drug pharmacists need to see health care.

Anything with a photo on it works as an ID

Someone can pickup

Controlled drugs required ID.
